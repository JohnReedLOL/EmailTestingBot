# This is not a properties file, it just has the .properties extension for syntax highlighting.
# This is actually an sbt script. It does a style check by executing the following sbt commands:
eval { println("Begin Script!") }
scalastyle
eval { println("Style Check Done!") }
compile
eval { println("Compile Done!") }
test
eval { println("Test Done!") }

# You can run this script via the sbt shell command: < check_style_script.properties
# For details, see: https://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Command-Line-Reference.html
