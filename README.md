#### Testing Canary

This is a system that continually runs tests and, if a failure occurs, sends out emails.

This is a demo of a very simple canary that sends email via the Apache-Commons-Email library (https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-email/).

To demo the email testing functionality, run Main and then sign into the dummy email account to see the email.

To run the canary continuously, execute this task from the sbt shell:

> runCanaryTask

This task will generate a random number every 5 seconds. If the random number is odd, it will send an email.

Note that to enable login, I turned off the email security settings in Gmail via these steps:

- Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/
- Sign in as "UsernameForAutomatedTesting@gmail.com"
- Go to: Sign-in & Security
- 2-Step Verification: Off
- Allow less secure apps: ON

Do not use a dummy email account for anything other than automatically generating email on test failure.

Note that if you know the network carrier (ex. AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, or Verizon) and the phone number associated with a cell phone, it is possible to send an email that gets received as a text message.

See: https://www.lifewire.com/sms-gateway-from-email-to-sms-text-message-2495456

Also, it is possible to extract the email address of the last person who pushed a code change by parsing the output of the "git log" command.
This can be used to bother people who broke the code.

By using a testing canary, it is possible to continuously make sure that the codebase is working.

Note: If you cannot access GitHub, here is some sample code:

runCanaryTask definition in build.sbt:

        email.setHostName("smtp.googlemail.com")
        val portNumber = 465
        email.setSmtpPort(portNumber)
        email.setAuthenticator(new DefaultAuthenticator(emailUsername, emailPassword))
        val sendResult = email.setSSLOnConnect(true)
          .setFrom(myEmailAddress)
          .setSubject(subject)

      }
      val emailSubject = "Autoreply: Test Internet Failure"
      val emailBody = "A test failed. It is all your fault!"
      val emailRecipient = myEmailAddress // Defaults to sending email to yourself.
      try {
        sendEmail(emailSubject, emailBody, emailRecipient)
      } catch {
        case e: Exception => log.info(s"Attempting to send the email to '$emailRecipient' failed with this exception: ${e.getMessage}")
      } finally {
        log.info(s"Finished sending email from: '$myEmailAddress' to: '$emailRecipient'")

    } else {
      log.info(s"Not sending email.")
    }
    val durationInMs = 5000
    Thread.sleep(durationInMs)
  }
}
```

You should see output that looks like this:

```
[info] Set current project to EmailTestingBot (in build file:.../EmailTestingBot/)
[info] Not sending email.
[info] Sending email.
[info] sendResult: <1452870640.0.1541644807523@mycomputer>
